*Fargo* is a 1996 Film directed by the Coen Brothers about a spree of crime that occurs in Minnesota and North Dakota. It runs about an hour and 40 minutes, but the world building that occurs during a relatively short time is astounding. The snowy tundra that serves as the backdrop for every outdoor scene is like a character of its own. It serves as a blank and expressionless backdrop of the thrilling action that happens within it. The Minnesota accents are a wonderful touch to the movie, and juxtapose with the seriousness of the crimes in a clever way.

There are many shots in the movie in which the only thing that isn't a colorless abyss of snow and ice is a character. To me, this was symbolic of the fantastic characters in this movie. The two criminals were a perfect duo - Steve Buscemi as the talkative, jumpy one and Peter Stormare opposite him as the slow and brooding but precise one. The detective and her husband were actually a very cute couple that I enjoyed. The detective, Frances McDormand, was great in her role. She had the same charming Minnesota accent that the other, less intelligent characters had while still being an extremely smart and effective investigator, all while 7 months pregant. 

The way that the Minnesota people seem to be completely unphased by the gruesome murders was a bit of a shock, but at the same time puts the viewer at ease. This contrasts with Steve Buscemi's character, which as far as I know is the only one in the movie not from Minnesota. He is clearly out of place in the film's setting, constantly swearing, yelling, and unable to relax in the car without speaking with his slow, brooding partner. The viewer may find themself relating with his character, as he plays a straight man and is the only person to acknowledge the quirkiness and at times ridiculousness of the other characters.

The main character, played by William H. Macy, is very easy to root against. From pretty early on it's clear that his plan is not going to work as he intends and he will likely face a tragic end. Yet, his slimy nature as seen when he charges a car-buyer for "True Coat" against their wishes makes this ending exactly what the audience wants to see. He's also a terrible liar and, like a lot of the background characters, not very intelligent.

I really enjoyed this movie and I would highly recommend it. I may be biased because I am a big fan in general of fictional crime movies. *Fargo*'s memorable characters and world building make the film feel isolated and self-supporting, much like the cold and rural midwestern setting it inhabits.
