title: "Switching to Astro Framework, and Other Dev Things"

It has been a while since I've published a blog entry. The website has been down for some time now, mostly because I didn't want to pay to keep it running. I am making some major changes though. Not really changes that you will see, though. I have switched from pure HTML/CSS to the Astro framework. I originally did not want to use a framework for this website, but I found one that seems very focused on just static content which is all I really want from this website. It has a layout feature, so I don't have to rewrite the header and footer on every page, as well as a neat 'content collections' feature that allows me to write repeated content like these blog posts in a format like markdown and then Astro will turn it into the proper HTML. My hope is that by using Astro it will take out a bunch of the redundant html I was writing.

On the Roomserve front, I've began creating a frontend client for it using React Native. I hope to have some kind of demo version available for it on a subdomain of offthegully.

For Java Zombies, I looked into if I could make a demo version of it on this website. It does not seem possible without rewriting/transpiling it to JavaScript, which I don't like the idea of. Instead, I plan on creating a legitimate executable version of it (not just a .jar) and sharing that here, as well as a video demo of it.
