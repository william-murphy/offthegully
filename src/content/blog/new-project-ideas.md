title: "New Project Ideas"

Recently I've been trying to come up with one project idea every day, no matter how stupid or frivolous the idea may seem. I've been writing them down in my notes app on my phone. At first I was struggling to think of ideas like always, but as I do it more and more I feel like I'm having an easier time thinking creatively about project ideas that interest me.

One project that I have actually started development on is a spanish verb conjugation api. The idea is an API that you can call like ```/api/tener/present/indicative/yo``` and it would response with *tengo* as that is the present indicative yo form of the verb tener. I think dev-wise it shouldn't present any real difficulties, it may just take a while to implement all of the different kinds of verb conjugations. I'm writing it in Go with the Chi router library because I really enjoyed writing an API previously with this stack. I think that this project will help me learn spanish as well.

Once I'm done, I want to host the API on my DigitalOcean VM, maybe at a subdomain of offthegully.com, so that anyone can try it out.
