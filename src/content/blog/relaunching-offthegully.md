I've been working on relaunching offthegully.com, this time without creating a custom nginx config, because it's not necessary. I've made some updates to the site, including link to downloadable jars of java zombies, implemented ordering of the projects posts, and fixed a big with the 'contact' link in the header. Hopefully I can get this new DigitalOcean droplet to work, it's been a while since I've messed around with this...
