What you're currently looking at. The source code is on Github. For my job I use a lot of React and other newer frontend libraries. Those frameworks do all sorts of cool things but it gets tiresome and often frustrating with so much going on under the hood. That's why I decided to create my personal website out of simple, static HTML pages with regular CSS styling. Writing plain HTML and CSS is actually pretty enjoyable, and extremely cathartic. I also used building this website as an opportunity to learn some basic Nginx, Docker, web hosting, and CI/CD.
