Blog and personal portfolio created with the Astro web framework. The website is written in mostly TypeScript via Astro's `.astro` files with some basic HTML thrown in, as well as vanilla CSS for styling. The projects and blog pages were generated from markdown files via Astro's content collections feature. The website is containerized using Docker with Apache httpd, running on a DigitalOcean droplet, and served from behind a reverse proxy set up with NGINX.
